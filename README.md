Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
=================================
RPN calculator in Ruby. Please excuse (and potentially let me know) me for 
any cringe worthy Ruby style mistakes. This little implementation was my
first time writing Ruby code ever!
- Ruby version: 1.9.3p0
- The implementation handles decimals and negative numbers
- Expand expression expands the RPN into an equivalent sequence of 1s and 2s.

##Basic Usage
```
ruby rpn.rb "1 2 +"
```
###Expand Expression
```
ruby rpn.rb "1 2 +" -e
```

###Display Help:
```
 ruby rpn.rb "1 2 +" -h
 ruby rpn.rb -h
```

###Run Unit Tests:
```
ruby rpn.rb "1 2 +" -h
ruby rpn.rb -h
```
